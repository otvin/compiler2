# compiler2

Goal is to eventually build a Pascal compiler.  Compiler is written in python3 in Ubuntu.  The assembly files are written in NASM format.  You must install NASM via e.g. ```sudo apt-get install nasm``` in order for the program to compile the assembly.

### Current Status

Supports a series of write() or writeln() calls, each with one or more comma-separated parameters, which must be either an integer, a math expression with addition, multiplication, or subtraction of integers, or string literal.

### To run it:

```python3 compiler.py helloworld.pas```
